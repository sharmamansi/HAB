# Description
Our solution is a two-way system between a user and health provider.The solution that weâ€™ll develop is a web application named Sewak App, which leverages information from a patient questionnaire regarding COVID-19-related symptoms and up-to-date information from medical centers to provide optimized medical center suggestions to patients for their needs. Our platform can provide support by medical centers around the country, they will be able to provide critical up-to-date information such as: number of COVID-19 tests, number of available ventilators, PPE status, number of COVID-19 patients, type of medical facility(full care, testing only, non-COVID only) to help further guide our algorithm on matching patients with the correct hospitals. Furthermore, we hope to make this data accessible to all medical institutions accessing our database.
